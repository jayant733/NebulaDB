# NebulaDB

A distributed, fault-tolerant SQL database engine written in Go — **from scratch**.

Not a CRUD app. Not a PostgreSQL wrapper. This project implements storage, recovery, consensus, and a focused SQL subset as real internals.

## Current status

**Phase 3 — Indexing** is current: LSM secondary indexes + an in-memory B+ tree. SQL `CREATE INDEX` is Phase 4.

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| KV `Set` / `Get` / `Delete` | Implemented |
| Write-Ahead Log + `fsync` | Implemented |
| Crash recovery via WAL replay | Implemented |
| In-memory MemTable (skip list) | Implemented |
| LSM / SSTables / Bloom / compaction | Implemented |
| Secondary indexes + B+ tree | Implemented |
| SQL | Phase 4 |
| Transactions | Phase 5 |
| Raft cluster | Phase 6 |

Do not claim distributed SQL, Raft, or Kubernetes until those phases exist and are tested.

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.22+.

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...

go run ./cmd/nebuladb --data ./data
```

Interactive commands:

```
row 1 20 jayant
idxcreate age 0
idxfind age 20
idxrange age 18 30
flush
stats
exit
```

Restart with the same `--data` directory after a crash. Mutations are durable once the WAL append has been synced.

## Documentation

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) | Phased plan and acceptance criteria |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | Target architecture vs what exists today |
| [docs/storage.md](docs/storage.md) | WAL, MemTable, durability, recovery |
| [docs/consistency.md](docs/consistency.md) | Intended consistency model |
| [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) | Architecture Decision Records |

## Principles

1. **Implement internals.** Storage, recovery, and consensus are first-class code.
2. **Prove, don't advertise.** Throughput and p99 come from benchmarks. Never invent numbers.
3. **Each phase is independently demoable.** A WAL-backed KV store is already interview-grade if you can explain `fsync` and replay.
4. **Correctness before distribution.** A wrong single-node engine plus Raft is still a wrong cluster.
